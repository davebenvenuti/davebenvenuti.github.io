The cloud is amazing, but it's also complex. Rubber is a tool for managing cloud services and deploying all of your app. Deploying is about a lot more than just getting your code transferred someplace. Rubber handles server creation, firewall rules, automated database backups, changing DNS entries, and zero downtime deploys. It takes care of a lot of the things you might not think of, but definitely will need.
